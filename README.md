# News Search

News Search Website
Welcome to the News Search Website, a platform that allows users to search news articles, save them for later, and log in to manage their preferences. Powered by the NewsExplorerAPI, this app provides a simple, user-friendly interface to explore the latest news based on specific keywords.

Features
Search News: Enter keywords and get a list of linked articles from various news sources.
Save Articles: Log in and save articles for future reference.
User Authentication: Create an account, log in, and manage your saved articles.

About Me:  I'm Cole Essig, a full-stack developer skilled in HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I specialize in building dynamic, responsive web applications and use tools like Mongoose for database management and BEM for scalable CSS architecture. I enjoy creating seamless user experiences and managing both front-end and back-end development.

Technologies Used
React: The front-end framework that powers the user interface.
NewsExplorerAPI: An external API that provides the news data.
Node.js (Future Integration): A custom backend using Node.js and Mongoose will be added in the future.
